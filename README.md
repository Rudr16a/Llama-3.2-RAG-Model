# README: Llama 3.2 RAG Model for Infographic PDF Q&A

## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of a **Llama 3.2 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model** designed to process infographic PDFs and answer user questions based on the content. The system uses Llama 3.2 to generate answers from both textual and visual information extracted from the PDFs, providing an interactive question-answering experience.

The application is built using **Streamlit** for the user interface and integrates both natural language processing (NLP) and image analysis techniques to handle complex infographic content.

## Features

- **PDF Upload**: Users can upload infographic-rich PDF documents for analysis.
- **Infographic Parsing**: The model analyzes both text and image-based elements in the PDF using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and text extraction techniques.
- **Question-Answering**: The Llama 3.2 model provides answers to questions based on retrieved information from the infographic content.
- **RAG Integration**: The Retrieval-Augmented Generation system retrieves relevant sections of the document before generating answers using the Llama 3.2 model.

## How It Works

1. **PDF Parsing**: When a user uploads a PDF, the system extracts text using a PDF extraction tool (like PyPDF2 or pdfplumber).
2. **Infographic Extraction**: The system processes infographic images within the PDF using OCR to convert images to text and extract any data visualizations or key statistics.
3. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: The RAG component retrieves relevant parts of the PDF based on user queries, providing context for the Llama 3.2 model to generate accurate answers.
4. **Answer Generation**: Llama 3.2 generates answers based on the content retrieved, incorporating both the textual and visual elements of the infographic.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/llama-3.2-infographic-rag.git
cd llama-3.2-infographic-rag
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Download Llama 3.2 Model

Download the **Llama 3.2** model from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) or another source and place it in the `models/` directory.

### 4. Run the Application

To start the application, use the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will launch the Streamlit application in your browser.

## Usage

1. **Upload PDF**: The user can upload an infographic-based PDF document via the file uploader.
2. **Ask Questions**: In the provided input box, the user can ask questions regarding the infographic content (e.g., "What is the main takeaway from this infographic?").
3. **Get Answers**: The system will process the query using the Llama 3.2 model and display the answer based on the extracted content of the PDF.

### Example Workflow

- **Upload**: User uploads a PDF titled "Data Science Trends 2023."
- **Question**: "What is the predicted average temperature increase in Greece by 2100 according to the most probable scenario ?"
- **Answer**: "According to the model ........................................"

## Dependencies

The main dependencies for the project are:

- Python 3.8+
- Streamlit
- PyPDF2 (or pdfplumber) for PDF text extraction
- OCR library (like Tesseract) for extracting text from infographics
- Hugging Face `transformers` library for the Llama 3.2 model
- `faiss` or another retrieval system for the RAG mechanism

To install the dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Limitations

- **Infographic Complexity**: The system may struggle with highly complex or dense infographics that blend text, images, and charts in unusual ways.
- **OCR Accuracy**: The quality of OCR might impact the accuracy of the extracted text, especially for low-resolution infographics.
- **Model Size**: Llama 3.2 requires substantial computational resources to run effectively, especially for large documents.

## Future Enhancements

- **Enhanced Image Recognition**: Improved integration with image recognition models to better analyze graphs, charts, and other non-textual elements in the infographic.
- **Fine-tuning Llama 3.2**: Fine-tuning the model specifically for infographic datasets to improve the relevance and accuracy of the answers.
- **Interactive Visuals**: Incorporating interactive visual elements for better exploration of the infographic content alongside Q&A.
